8.44 is a web experience coded by Dylan Stratton based on the play *4.48 Psychosis* by Sarah Kane.

Each scene of the play is condensed to one sketch - usually involving an animation or some form of user interaction. The sketches are not intended to encapsulate the entire scene. Instead, the sketches are meant to capture a moment, a phrase, an emotion.

The main technology used in this project is [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
